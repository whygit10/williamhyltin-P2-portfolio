      <p>I hold a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and am currently in my final semester to complete my Masters of Science in Data Analytics at UTSA.</p>
      <p>Talk to me about Omnichannel data, music, or dungeons and dragons!</p>

  <h1> Welcome to my Website and Data Analysis Profile</h1>
  <p>This site will serve as a repository for different analytic exercises and assignments done over the course of my education in the Data Analytics Masters Program at UTSA and beyond. This means that this site will be perpetually under construction. Here you can expect to find:
  <ul>
  <li>Analyses</li>
  <li>Visualizations</li>
  <li>Applications of statistical methods</li>
  <li>The slow spiral of a man drowning in the sea of his own imposter syndrome</li>
  <li>Insights, hopefully</li></ul></p>
  <p>Please use the Menu Bar at the top to visit the various projects and pages I have included. To provide some guidance, the four Case Studies are some of the most complete projects. Each one was a collaborative effort where we were given a problem and a dataset intended to solve that problem, however we were somewhat limited to only select algorithms when modeling out our solution, by nature of what was covered in the course. The Crime in Austin, TX project was a final project wherein I tried my hand at various time-series forecasting techniques I had never used before. The presentation exercise contains my personal favorite visualization of all those I have worked on. Other projects listed are somewhat less complete, for the sake of the assignment timeframe we were only expected to do so much, but still contain some nice examples of various techniques that I have employed.</p>
<p>Finally, if you'd like to know more about me or my background, you can read the About Me page in the Menu Bar or take a look at my Resume linked in the sidebar. Thanks for visiting! </p>
