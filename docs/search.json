Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/Hylti/OneDrive/Documents/School/Practicum II/williamhyltin-P2-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

    "section": "",
    "text": "My name is William Hyltin, I am currently a student in the Master of Science in Data Analytics program at the University of Texas at San Antonio. I have roughly 2 years of experience as an analyst, a year and a half as a Reporting Analyst for Omnichannel Analytics for a bank, and about 4 months of experience as a Business Strategy Analyst for the Actuary and Analytics organization of an insurance company. Professionally I’ve had the opportunity to use a number of different platforms, to include SQL (Snowflake, PROC SQL, and some SQL Server), SAS Enterprise Guide, Minitab, and Excel. Educationally I’ve had the opportunity to use R, Tableau, SAS (both Base and Enterprise Guide), and Python. Prior to working as an Analyst I worked for a call center as a phone representative, but my aspirations at the time had been to be come an Actuary, for which I was able to complete the first two exams (Probability and Financial Markets). It was ultimately several rejections for an entry level actuarial role that lead to me to my job as a Reporting Analyst, but I am finding that these more Data Analyst and adjacent roles are more enjoyable than the work I would have been doing as an Actuary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy work as a reporting analyst was rotational, and had me on a team of several other Strategy Analysts. As a result I ended up doing a lot of strategy analytics work in addition to my reporting responsibilities. Some of my responsibilities in the role were reporting on several call center metrics, like satisfaction survey results, handle time of calls, and call volume. The more strategic work I got to do were things like root cause analysis for changes in performance metrics, estimating the impacts that future changes would have on those metrics, and setting goals for call center employees based on their current performance and skills. Most of the work I did here was done in Snowflake SQL, excel, and SAS. I would use statistical techniques like regression, ANOVA, t-test, and descriptive statistics, then utilize my findings to build reports, visualizations, and make recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has often been said to me that analysts will spend 80% of their time massaging their data before they can start on the “real” analytic work. My role as a Business Strategy Analyst is intended to combat that. I work on a team whose purpose is to identify meaningful transactions or events that our customers are performing in complex and often disparate data, and translating this data into a consumable format so that Analysts can spend more time focusing on answering the questions at hand. This is similar to what a Data Engineer might do, but with a greater focus on how the business itself operates, and what an analyst would be looking for given a request from the business. This also means that analyses that we do are usually done in the name of accuracy over insight, and there is less of an opportunity for statistic methods outside of things like frequency-related measures and the occasional descriptive statistic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe genesis of this site is from my Practicum II class for my Masters Program, in which I am excited about the opportunity to create a proper portfolio for myself. I see it as a means of displaying the kind of real work I am capable of, and as a way to inspire myself to take on more curiosity projects that go beyond the requirements of formal education and my profession. I’m also excited for the opportunity to use more R, since its not a language I get to use often but when I do I always enjoy it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond my professional and educational experience, I have a number of other interests that I struggle to make time for. I play dungeons and dragons fairly regularly on the weekends with a few other friends. I enjoy reading, particularly horror and classic science fiction (think more Flowers for Algernon and Invisible Man than Ender’s Game). My girlfriend and I like going to concerts when we can, most recent standouts have been the reunion tour for the Postal Service and a Hot Mulligan show where one of the openers threw Burger Boy burgers into the crowd. I have two kids, a 6 year old aspiring princess/ doctor/ dancer/ singer/ chef, and a soon to be 14 year old son who is a trumpet and piano master with aspirations to become a music therapist."

Prior to working as an Analyst I worked for a call center as a phone representative, but my aspirations at the time had been to be come an Actuary, for which I was able to complete the first two exams (Probability and Financial Markets). It was ultimately several rejections for an entry level actuarial role that lead to me to my job as a Reporting Analyst, but I am finding that these more Data Analyst and adjacent roles are more enjoyable than the work I would have been doing as an Actuary."

    "text": "My work as a reporting analyst was rotational, and had me on a team of several other Strategy Analysts. As a result I ended up doing a lot of strategy analytics work in addition to my reporting responsibilities. Some of my responsibilities in the role were reporting on several call center metrics, like satisfaction survey results, handle time of calls, and call volume. The more strategic work I got to do were things like root cause analysis for changes in performance metrics, estimating the impacts that future changes would have on those metrics, and setting goals for call center employees based on their current performance and skills. Most of the work I did here was done in Snowflake SQL, excel, and SAS. I would use statistical techniques like regression, ANOVA, t-test, and descriptive statistics, then utilize my findings to build reports, visualizations, and make recommendations."

    "text": "It has often been said to me that analysts will spend 80% of their time massaging their data before they can start on the “real” analytic work. My role as a Business Strategy Analyst is intended to combat that. I work on a team whose purpose is to identify meaningful transactions or events that our customers are performing in complex and often disparate data, and translating this data into a consumable format so that Analysts can spend more time focusing on answering the questions at hand. This is similar to what a Data Engineer might do, but with a greater focus on how the business itself operates, and what an analyst would be looking for given a request from the business. This also means that analyses that we do are usually done in the name of accuracy over insight, and there is less of an opportunity for statistic methods outside of things like frequency-related measures and the occasional descriptive statistic."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/Hylti/OneDrive/Documents/School/Practicum II/williamhyltin-P2-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."
