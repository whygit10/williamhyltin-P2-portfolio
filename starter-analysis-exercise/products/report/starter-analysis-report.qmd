_Antonio Flores contributed to this exercise._

The structure below is one possible setup for a data analysis project (including the course project). For a manuscript, adjust as needed. 
You don't need to have exactly these sections, but the content covering those sections should be addressed.

This uses MS Word as output format. [See here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html) for more information. You can switch to other formats, like html or pdf. See [the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/) for other formats.

# Summary/Abstract
_Write a summary of your project._


{{< pagebreak >}}


# Introduction 

## General Background Information
_Provide enough background on your topic that others can understand the why and how of your analysis_ 

## Description of data and data source
In addition to the standard variables of Height (in centimeters), Weight (in kilograms), and identified gender (Male, Female, Other), I have included twp additional variables: Generation and Salary. Generation represents the respondents age categorized into the self reported generation to which they belong, e.g. Gen Z are those with birth years between 1995 and 2012. Salary is the self reported annual salary in thousands of US dollars, e.g. a value of 70 would represent an annual salary of $70,000.

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
_State the research questions you plan to answer with this analysis._

To cite other work (important everywhere, but likely happens first in introduction), make sure your references are in the bibtex file specified in the YAML header above (here `dataanalysis_template_references.bib`) and have the right bibtex key. Then you can include like this:

Examples of reproducible research projects can for instance be found in [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a]

# Methods 

_Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement._


## Data aquisition
_As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next._


## Data import and cleaning
_Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along._


## Statistical analysis
_Explain anything related to your statistical analyses._

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project._


@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below. **I recommend the `here` package, but I'm showing the other approach here just in case you encounter it.**

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/tables-files/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```



## Basic statistical analysis

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._


@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```


## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
_Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means._

## Strengths and Limitations
_Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis._

## Conclusions
_What are the main take-home messages?_

_Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end_

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses. 

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.

# Additional Variables, Visualizations, and Tables

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable3
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table for additional variables."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable3 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable3.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable3)
```

The table of our linear model for the new variables concludes that there is not a linear relationship between Height and a respondents Age or Generation. Against an alpha level of 0.05, none of the variables were found to be statistically significant, so we would fail to reject the null hypothesis.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result2
#| fig-cap: "Height boxplot by generation."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","height-generation-boxplot.png"))
```

The boxplots reveal how the distribution of Height across each generation differs. Generation X appears to have the most variation in Height, while Gen Z has relatively little variation and has a higher IQR. The Millennial and Baby Boomer generations had only one respondent each, so a greater sample size would be necessary to make a proper conclusion about the relationship between Height and Generation.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result3
#| fig-cap: "Height boxplot by generation."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","salary-weight-scatter.png"))
```
The scatterplot of Weight and Salary appears to reveal more of a relationship. It appears that the larger a respondent's Weight, the more likely they are to report a lower salary. There are some potential outliers that may contradict this conclusion, so further testing and sampling would be ideal to make a proper conclusion about the relationship.
