    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is William Hyltin, but I usually go by Will.</p>
    <div class="indented">
    <p>I am a Business Strategy Analyst in the Property and Casualty insurance industry. My current job focus is in building data for reporting and analyst consumption, specifically in the product and omni-channel spaces. This involves working with several different complex and disparate data sources, so data that is difficult to work with is often where I feel most comfortable. In this role I have developed skills in SQL, gathering business requirements, and an understanding of procedures around data pipelines.</p>
    <p>Prior to my current role I was a rotational Reporting Analyst in the banking industry. My focus here was also in omni-channel data, but instead I was consuming data for reporting and ad-hoc needs. It was in this role that I first learned SQL and had the opportunity to use techniques like t-tests, linear regression, ANOVA, and descriptive statistics. Most work was performed in SAS Enterprise Guide or Excel, which are the tools I would use to build reports, visualizations, and deliver insights.</p>
    <p>Currently I am a student at the University of Texas at San Antonio, where I am working to obtain a Master’s of Science in Data Analytics. I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics, with a Minor in Statistics. During the course of my education, I have had the opportunity to gain experience in a number of different languages and platforms, to include R, Python, SAS (both base and Enterprise Guide), SQL, gretl, and Matlab. Prior to investing into a more data analytics-focused role, I passed the first two Actuarial Exams, Probability and Financial Markets.</p>
    <p>Beyond my professional and educational experience, I have a number of other interests that I struggle to make time for. I enjoy reading, particularly horror and classic science fiction (think more Flowers for Algernon and Invisible Man than Ender's Game). I am a level 10 Dwarf Sorcerer in a Dungeons and Dragons campaign I play with some friends on the weekends. My fiancée and I enjoy going to concerts when we can, and we have two children, a 7 year old aspiring princess/ doctor/ dancer/ singer/ chef, and a 14 year old son who is a trumpet and piano master with aspirations to become a music therapist.</p>
