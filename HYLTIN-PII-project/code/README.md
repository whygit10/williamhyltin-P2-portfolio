# code

This folder will contain all code for processing, exploratory work, and analysis. The `processing-code` folder contains code to clean and save the raw data to a processed data file in the `data -> processed-data` folder. The `eda-code` folder will contain general exploratory analysis, as well as some work in statistical analysis, at least until the models get more complicated. This also means the `analysis-code` folder is mostly empty, for now.
