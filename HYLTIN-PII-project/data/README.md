# data

The folders inside this folder contains all data at various stages.

This data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the `code` folders.

Data placed in the `raw-data` folder is unchanged from when it was acquired, it has not and will not be edited. Once I have processed the data it will be saved separately in the `processed-data` folder.
